# PortfolioOptimizationWithCAPM

This is a final project for a college course called Operations Research. In the project, I explained what the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is and conducted a study that emphasized both the financial and mathematical aspects of the model. Then, I developed a linear programming model based on the CAPM to optimize asset allocation in a portfolio. Subsequently, I designed a trading strategy to maximize the returns of the portfolio. Finally, I implemented the backtesting in Python using historical data and incorporating the linear programming model solution.
